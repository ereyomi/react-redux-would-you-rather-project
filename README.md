This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. I recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

## Usage
`npm start` .
`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.
